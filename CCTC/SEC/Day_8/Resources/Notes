HOST ENUMERATION LINUX

(Focus on information gathering for exploiting later)

https://blog.g0tmi1k.com/2011/08/basic-linux-privilege-escalation/?redirect


What are we trying to accomplish doing host enumeration?
    • Gathering information about the environment in order  to escalate privileges, gather more information about the network, learn the habits of an admin is he a baddie.. There was times during ops you had to actually fix their own network for them in order to complete a task

When checking directories remember to always use ls -la. You never know what can be hiding.



Linux Commands
date & time	        knowing date and time can help correlate logs and identify target's time zone 
whoami	            who we are logged in as
id		            permissions group ( do we have root permissions)
groups 	            see what groups we are in (are we in the sudoers)
sudo -l             do we have any binaries that execute with higher privs  
cat /etc/passwd	    user information
cat /etc/shadow     user information (need privileged access)
w                   who is logged in, terminal and what they are doing (tty are direct connections to the pc.. So pts are ssh or telnet connections)
last                information about users that logged in (user habits, might need to avoid times)
uptime              how long has the machine been up (would this make for a good pivot)
hostname            name of machine
uname -a            kernel information architecture
cat /etc/*rel*      OS version information


Networking Information

ip addr                 info about the network interfaces (IPs, subnets, etc.)
ifconfig -a             info about the network interfaces (IPs, subnets, etc.) (Depricated)
cat /etc/hosts          translates hostnames or domain names to ip addresses ( could see a name to another box, might point a target of interest Windows Server )
cat /etc/resolv.conf    configure dns name servers 
ss -antp                displays TCP socket information (listening ports and established connections along with process associated with the socket)(-p needs root privs)
netstat -antp           displays TCP socket information (listening ports and established connections along with process associated with the socket)(-p needs root privs)
netstat -anup           displays UDP socket information
netstat -rn             prints routing table
arp -an                 prints arp table


Process Information
ps -ef                                  prints all processes in full-format listing
ps -auxf 	                            prints all processes in and some other info in different format
lsof -p [pid] 	                        list of open files opened by the process identified by its pid
ls -al /proc/[pid]                      list directrory of a specific pid
service --status-all    	            shows all services and if they are running or not 
systemctl list-units --type=service     another way to list all services depending on type of linux system



Logging
cat /etc/rsyslog.conf   default rsyslog config file, check rules and for remote logging 
/etc/rsyslog.d 		    directory where config files are kept we want to check those also.
/var/log		        default location for linux system logs


Crontabs
Why might we want to check Crontabs? What could we take advantage of?
Crontabs are owned by respective users so you will not be able to see other users crontabs.
Multiple ways and places to look for cron jobs/scripts.
/var/spool/cron/crontabs
/etc/cron.d
ls -la /etc/cron*
cat /etc/cron*  crontab
sudo crontab -u student -l



Finding files and locations to check
find usaga examples:
find / -name password* 2>/dev/null      find any file starting with the word password 
find / -iname *test* 2>/dev/null        find any file with "test" somewhere in its name, ignoring capitalization
find / -type f -name *.txt              find all .txt files        
find / -type f -name ".*"               find all hidden files
find / -type d -name ".*"               find all hidden directories



/tmp		check tmp folders (world writable)
/home	 	check home folders for users
/etc        default location for config files








HOST ENUMERATION WINDOWS

General Information

Date /t
Time /t
Hostname
Whoami
systeminfo

User Information
Net user
Net localgroup
Net localgroup administrators
Net use ( if any shares are mapped)


Network Information
Ipconfig /all
Ipconfig /displaydns
Route print

Netstat -anob ( need to be admin)


Interesting Locations
Explorer - view - hidden items ( turn on show hidden items )
Check users documents,downloads,desktops
Dir c:\windows\prefetch ( admin ) = see what executables have been ran
Dir /a:h
dir /o:d /t:w c:\windows\system32
dir /o:d /t:w c:\windows\system32\winevt\logs
dir /o:d /t:w c:\windows\temp
reg query hklm\software\microsoft\windows\currentversion\run /s   (don’t forget about hkcu) and runonce


Process and Services 
Tasklist /v
Tasklist /svc
tasklist /svc | findstr /i "PID"

Services.msc ( gui )
for /f "tokens=2 delims='='" %a in ('wmic service list full^|find /i "pathname"^|find /i /v "system32"') do @echo %a
Sc query <service name>

Schtasks
Task sch ( gui )
schtasks /query /fo LIST /v
schtasks /query
