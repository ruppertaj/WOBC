Terminal Learning Objectives
1. Describe User Account Control Bypass
2. Identify User Account Control Activity
3. Complete Windows User Account Control CTFd Challenges PE


1.1 What is UAC and what does it do

Most Windows installers create a single user account, which is an administrative account, when setting up Windows and then move on. Because of this, most users perform tasks on their Windows machine as an admin, and that allows malware to run as admin. UAC was created to protect users from themselves.
Stands for User Account Control

    UAC limits the privileges of user run applications, even when run as Administrator, to prevent the modification of system files, resources, or settings.

    Requesting elevated privileges requires explicit, interactive acknowledgement from the user. [6]

    If the user is in the local administrators group, they can click through the prompt, or if not in the Administrator group, can enter the administrator password to complete the action

    Registry key is located at "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System"

	UAC is the Windows equivalent to Linux sudo


1.2 What do UAC prompts look like
	See UAC Slide 9 for images Public Antora Page

Demo: Attempt to install Immunity Debugger from a non-admin cmd shell. Point out that UAC prompts for action

Immunity Debugger Download
Multiple color-coded consent prompts

    Red - Application or publisher blocked by group policy

    Blue & gold - Administrative application

    Blue - Trusted and Authenticode signed application

    Yellow - Unsigned or signed but not trusted application

1.3 How does UAC know how to act

When an application is run, UAC checks that file’s manifest for instructions

What is a file Manifest?

    A manifest file on Windows holds Metadata and tells Windows how the file should be executed.

There are three types of execution levels in a file’s manifest.

    asInvoker - The application will run with the same permissions as the process that started it. The application can be elevated to a higher permission level by selecting Run as Administrator.

        Ex: C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe

    requireAdministrator - The application will run with administrator permissions. The user who starts the application must be a member of the Administrators group. If the opening process is not running with administrative permissions, the system will prompt for credentials.

    highestAvailable - The application will run with the highest permission level that it can. If the user who starts the application is a member of the Administrators group, this option is the same as requireAdministrator. If the highest available permission level is higher than the level of the opening process, the system will prompt for credentials.

        Ex: C:\Windows\regedit.exe

1.3.1 Autoelevate setting

    Some Windows executables can "auto elevate" without a prompt.

    Files that have "auto elevate" in their permissions will not prompt UAC


1.4 View file manifest settings

The Sysinternals Tool sigcheck will allow the viewing of these settings.
Map the Sysinternals Command in Powershell

PS C:\Users\student> net use * http://live.sysinternals.com
PS C:\Users\student> z:

View the autoelevate setting of slui

PS Z:\> ./sigcheck -m C:\Windows\System32\slui.exe

View the highest available setting of regedit

PS Z:\> ./sigcheck -m C:\windows\regedit.exe

How to locate Windows executables that have autoelevate in the manifest

PS Z:\> ./strings –s c:\windows\system32\*.exe | findstr /i autoelevate

1.5 DEMO: Bypass UAC with fodhelper.exe

What is fodhelper?

Fodhelper - Introduced in Windows 10 to manage optional features like region-specific keyboard settings. Fodhelper.exe is located in the C:\Windows\System32 folder

Explain how the UAC Bypass fodhelper exploit was found.

    Researcher used Procmon to find the registry keys being called that do not exist.

    Show the registry hives on screen and ask the students which hive can be edited as a non-admin user and ask why this is important to us? (Non-admin users can edit the HKCU keys and manipulate the behavior of the system)

        HKCU:\Software\Classes\ms-settings\shell\open\command

Demo using Procmon to find registry keys called by autoelevate applications

    Open Procmon

    Run fodhelper.exe

    Stop Capture

    Create Filter ProcessName is fodhelper.exe

    Create Filter Operation is RegOpenKey Action Include

    Look for Registry Keys HKCU\software\classes

    Look fro Registry Keys HKCU\ms-settings\shell\open\command

	Explain the Registry Key HKCU is writable by the user and that ms-settings\shell\open\command doesn’t exist so we can exploit this key to perform what behavior we want

What does this key allow us to do?

PS C:\Users\Student> HKCU:\Software\Classes\ms-settings\shell\open\command

    Enables us to provide to the program additional instructions on what to do when the program opens.

What does the DelegateExecute string value do?

    Tells the program to execute what is in the default value of the registry key.

Demo via GUI so students can do Activity via PowerShell and demonstrate command-line knowledge.
Look at autoElevate & requestedExecutionLevel

PS C:\Users\Student> ./sigcheck -m C:\windows\system32\fodhelper.exe

Open the registry editor

PS C:\Users\Student> regedit.exe

Create the key

Right click on HKCU:\Software\Classes and select New > Key

Name it ms-settings

Then add New > Key shell

Then add New > Key open

Then add New > Key command
Create the String Value

Right click in the whitespace on the right side of pane Create New > String Value DelegateExecute
Right Click on (Default) String value

Add C:\windows\system32\cmd.exe
From command-line execute

C:\windows\system32\fodhelper.exe

NOTE:A new window will pop up with Administrator privileges
